        "The Airbnb NYC 2019 analysis revealed meaningful patterns in customer preferences, pricing behavior, and market dynamics. Key findings showed that Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate the market with the highest listing prices, while Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island attract budget travelers due to their affordability. The study highlighted that Entire home/apartment listings generate the most revenue, whereas Private rooms maintain consistent demand. Correlation analysis indicated that price variations are influenced by multiple non-linear factors such as location desirability, amenities, and booking frequency rather than single numerical variables.\n",
